# Eliza Does Stuff
*We can never comprehend how far we've come.*

Hi, I'm **Eliza** (she/her). In case you couldn't tell, I do stuff. I am currently a sophomore in high school.
My current projects include:

* Games for Potatos, a set of simple single-player and local multiplayer games designed to run in the terminal to maximize speed and battery efficiency
* Conch\*, a cross-platform music player for the terminal (can you tell I like TUI?)
* Literally nothing else; I can't afford to start any more projects right now TwT

\* haha get it because conch is a shell and shell is a terminal thing
