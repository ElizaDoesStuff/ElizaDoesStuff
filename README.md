# Eliza Does Stuff
*We can never comprehend how far we've come.*

Hi!! I'm **Eliza** (she/her). In case you couldn't tell, I do stuff. I am currently a sophomore in high school.
My current projects include:

* Midterm, a terminal utilities library that abstracts away a lot of the platform-specific details of things like keyboard input and window resizing
* Conch, a cross-platform music player for the terminal\* (can you tell I like TUI?)
* Literally nothing else; I can't afford to start any more projects right now TwT

\* haha get it because conch is a shell and shell is a terminal thing
